    "text": "The sparse mixture of experts (MoE) in transformer models is an architectural innovation where, instead of applying a single, dense feed-forward network to every token, the model routes each input to only a few specialized \"expert\" subnetworks—typically just one or two—based on a gating mechanism. This sparsity significantly reduces computational cost during inference, as most experts remain unused for any given input, while still allowing the model to scale to a large number of parameters. The result is a highly efficient and scalable architecture that maintains strong performance, especially in large language models like Google's GLaM and Mixtral.",
