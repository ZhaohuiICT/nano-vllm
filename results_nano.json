    "text": "The sparse mixture of experts (MoE) in transformer models is an architectural innovation where, instead of applying a single, dense feed-forward network to every token, multiple specialized \"expert\" networks are available, and only a few are activated per input token based on a routing mechanism. This sparsity significantly reduces computational cost during inference, as most experts remain unused for any given input, enabling models to scale to much larger sizes without proportional increases in compute. The routing is typically learned dynamically, allowing the model to adaptively assign tokens to the most relevant experts, improving both efficiency and performance.<|im_end|>",
